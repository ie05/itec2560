  the browser window. This tag sets the width of the page equal to the

    <h1>Bootstrap buttons</h1>

    <p>Bootstrap can style and color-code buttons. </p>

    <P>The default colors aim to reflect the meaning of the buttons.
      It's up to you to decide on the meaning of the buttons in your app.</P>

    <P>So buttons for dangerous actions (e.g. delete your account) are red, warnings are orange.</p>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Delete everything!</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">This could be bad!</button>

    <P>Regular buttons are white/grey, info buttons are blue</P>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">Just a regular button</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">More info?</button>

    <P>Primary buttons, indicating the most likely flow for the application, are blue.
      Positive buttons are green</P>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Recommend clicking here!</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">A positive button!</button>

    <P>None of the buttons do anything yet, other than look nice.
      We'll wire up some button functionality soon!</P>
